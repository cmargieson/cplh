# Low Level Requirements

## Minimum Height Rules

- **Over a populous area or public gathering:** 1,000 ft above the highest feature or obstacle within a horizontal radius of 300 m of the point on the ground or water immediately below the helicopter.

- **Other areas:** 500 ft above the highest feature or obstacle within a horizontal radius of 300 m of the point on the ground or water immediately below the helicopter.

CASA requires pilots to
receive special training and endorsements before they can legally conduct low-level
flying

except during takeoff and landing, conducting a forced or precautionary
landing, or to avoid adverse weather conditions.

You are authorised to conduct a flight below these heights if you hold a helicopter category rating, low-level rating and have conducted a risk assessment before the flight.

If you have
been trained and are qualified for low flying, and low flying is necessary, ensure that you
conduct an aerial survey of the area from an appropriate height before you conduct any
low flying.

Aerial mustering, sling operations winching and rappelling have further training requirements.

## Low-level Endorsement Requirements

You must receive at least 5 hours of dual low-level training in a helicopter.

## Flight Review Requirements

You must have completed a low-level rating flight review within the previous 12 months.

## Recent Experience Requirements

You can only exercise the privileges of the rating if in the previous 6 months you have:

- Completed at least 2 hours of low‑level operations, or

- Been assessed as competent to conduct low‑level operations by a flight instructor who holds a low‑level training endorsement, or

- Completed an operator proficiency check in low‑level operations, or

- Completed a flight review for the rating within the previous 6 months.
