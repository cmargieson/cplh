# Vortex Ring State

Vortex Ring State (VRS) is a critical aerodynamic condition that can occur when a vortex ring system engulfs the rotor, leading to a loss of lift.

## Development of VRS

Vortex ring state can develop when the helicopter is:

- Operating at a low or zero airspeed (below the speed required for translational lift)
- Utilising some power (applying collective)
- Descending at a rate exceeding 300 feet per minute

Manoeuvres that are likely to result in Vortex Ring State include:

- Descending with power at low or zero airspeed
- Approaching downwind
- Descending during a steep flare or performing a downwind quick stop
- Adding power at the end of a simulated autorotation

## Effects on The Blade

### Effect on the root of the blade:

The induced flow is smallest near the mast because of the lower rotational speed of the blade. With an increase in the rate of descent flow, the induced flow diminishes, causing the angle of attack to increase until the section stalls.

### Effect on the tips of the blade:

Strengthening of the vortex action around the blade tips adds to induced flow, decreasing the angle of attack.



## Signs of VRS

Signs of Vortex Ring State include:

- Increasing rate of descent leading to a sudden lightness in the seat (low g sensation)
- Vibrations felt and heard as the blades hit the vortices of preceding blades
- Random uncontrolled pitch, roll, and yaw and reduced control authority of the cyclic

## Recovery from VRS

Recovery from Vortex Ring State:

If Vortex Ring State occurs, your initial reaction might be to raise the collective to decrease the descent rate. However, raising the pitch angles will increase the stalled area of the blades, increasing the descent rate.

The main priority should be relocating the rotor disk from the unfavourable airflow condition and preventing the descent flow from opposing the induced flow.

- Cyclic forward to increase airspeed
- Pause to allow airspeed to build
- Apply power
