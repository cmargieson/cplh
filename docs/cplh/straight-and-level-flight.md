title: "Straight and Level Flight"
---

Flight at constant altitude, airspeed and heading is straight and level flight.

Imagine each axis, from the side, front and above. Imagine flying in normal cruise attitude. The nose is pitched down slightly and the rotor disk is tilted forward. From aft the rotr disk is tilted slightly left ro counter the rightward thrust of the tail rotor. The roll axis is located below the tail rotor thrust axis. From above the main rotor rotation is counter-clockwise. The resulting torque would force the nose to the right if it were not for the anti-torque thrust of the tail rotor and vertical fin. The airflow over the main rotor and fuselage would tend to raise the tail if it were not for the synchronised elevator. In normal flight all forces are balanced and the helicopter is in equilibijum. From the cockpit, the horizon is horizontal 

Why is it hard in a helicopter? Stability.

## The Cyclic in Straight and Level Flight

<!-- What it does: -->

The cyclic controls rotor tilt, directing thrust. Tilting the rotor disc forward increases forward acceleration, while tilting it aft slows you down. Maintaining constant airspeed requires balancing thrust and drag forces. tilt the disc forward and the helicopter accelerates forward. when the forces of thrust and drag are in balance acceleration stops and a steady airspeed is maintained.

Not much change in fuselage pitch is required for a large change in airspeed.

When changing airspeed, use external references not instruments. Airspeed and altimiter delay. 

The helicopter is unstable, and will wander from where it is - constant small, bareley perceptible changes will be made. 

<!-- How to keep straight-and-level: -->

Where the horizon crosses the windshield.

Pitch control is the most important aspect of straight and level flight. A constant pitch is best determined by referencing the horizin with a fixed point on the windshield. Changes in pitch will be noticed as changes in the fixed point and the horizon. The horizon moves down, pitch up, the horizon moves up, pitch down. Look to the distance through your chosen fixed point to the horizon, don't keep eyes inside the cockpit.

| Cyclic  | Airspeed |
| ------- | -------- |
| Forward | Increase |
| Aft     | Decrease |

## The Collective in Straight and Level Flight

controls altitude by adjusting overall blade pitch, effectively raising or lowering the helicopter.

Controls the amount of thrust. 

In cruise, the power setting is constant.


## The Throttle in Straight and Level Flight 


## The Pedals in Straight and Level Flight

control trim, countering torque from the main rotor and preventing the fuselage from turning left or right.

In forward flight, the vertical fin provides a lot of stability - only small inputs are needed.

Left pedal, helicopter rotates to the left but flight path does not change. Right pedal, helicopter rotates to the right but flight path does not change.

## The Combined Effects of Controls in Straight and Level Flight

To increase airspeed forward cyclic raise collective left pedal

To decrease airspeed aft cyclic lower collective right pedal

Increase airspeed: forward cyclic, raise collective, and apply left pedal.
Decrease airspeed: aft cyclic, lower collective, and apply right pedal.

## Common Errors in Straight and Level FLight

Deviations: If no correction is made, the helicopter will start to wander. It is unstable. for example if the helicopter pitches up airspeed will decrease and it will start to climb. Putting the nose back to the same place won't fix the problem due to the lower airspeed. The climb woudl continue.

The correction irequires three steps. Stop the deviation, return to desired airspeed and altitude and maintain.

The pich will have to be lower than it was before to regain airspeed then go back to original pitch.

Control inputs take time to translate into actions. Stabilize your flight visually before relying on instruments, and give them time to settle before reacting further.

Don't cross control - using pedal opposite cyclic. Keep "wings level"
